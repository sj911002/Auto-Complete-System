# Auto-Complete-System

Auto-complete is a feature in which an application predicts the rest of a word a user is typing (predictive text). In this project I aim to build a prototype of an auto-complete system. This project uses N-grams, a simple but powerful method for language modeling. 
Dataset: Text corpus from twitter
Steps involved: 
1. Corpus preprocessing
2. Developing N-gram based language model
3. Evaluating the model using perplexity score
4. Building the auto-complete system
